	<p style="width:60%; margin:auto; text-align:left; font-weight:thiner; font-size:14px;">The quality of a pair of trousers is evident both in the time it takes to produce them, and in the intent behind creating them. Here, we aren't interested in mass production or quick turnaround time. Rather, we hope to adapt the traditional artisinal process to fit this modern marketplace.<br><br>
	For this reason, we confection our trousers one by one, step by step, 100% in-house. It's a tedious process, but one that allows for an end result of true value: a pair of trousers like those from long ago, born from the heart of an artisan.<br>  </p>
